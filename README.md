# Portugal-Bushfire-analysis-using-meteorological-data
In this project, I was exploring through various machine learning approaches to predict the burned area of bushfires by using the obtained meteorological data that are known to influence the wildfires. Initially, I analyzed the data, cleaned some data, removed some outliers using "Cooks Distance" and then tried to predict the burnt area through machine learning algorithms, and then cross-validated the implemented algorithms.
